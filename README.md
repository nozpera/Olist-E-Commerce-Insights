## Problem Statement

This project aims to analyze the **top 5 most popular product categories** in the Olist main dataset from **2016 to 2018** and calculate the **total revenue generated** over these three years. Additionally, it explores the relationship between the **main dataset** and the **marketing funnel dataset** to determine the number of sellers who successfully passed the consultant stage (SR).  

Since the **marketing funnel data is only available from June 1 2017, to June 1 2018**, the analysis focuses too on calculating the **total orders placed by these verified sellers**.

Furthermore, this project analyzes:  
‚úîÔ∏è The **total number of customers** linked to the marketing funnel  
‚úîÔ∏è The **total products sold**  
‚úîÔ∏è The **distribution of order statuses**  
‚úîÔ∏è A **time-series analysis** of order trends over time

## Project Solution

### 1. Data Extraction & Cleaning
- Utilized the **Olist main dataset (2016-2018)** and **Marketing Funnel dataset (2017-2018)**.
- Cleaned data by removing duplicates and handling missing values.

### 2. Data Transformation & Analysis
- Identified **top 5 most popular product categories** based on the number of products sold.
- Calculated **total revenue** from all product sales over three years.
- Merged **marketing funnel dataset** with **main dataset** to determine how many sellers successfully passed the SR stage.
- Measured **total orders**, **total customers**, and **total products sold** from sellers who passed the SR stage.
- Analyzed **order status distribution** to examine the proportion of delivered, canceled, and other orders.
- Conducted **time series analysis** to identify trends and fluctuations in order volume over time.
- Created a **geographical distribution analysis** of customers based on shipping locations.

### 3. Visualization & Insights
- Designed **interactive dashboards** using **Looker Studio**.
- Developed **time series charts**, **order status distribution charts**, **customer location maps**

### Conclusion
This analysis provides insights into Olist's sales trends, popular product categories, seller performance, and customer distribution. By integrating data from the marketing funnel, we can further understand seller progression and their impact on total sales.
